### Hello there 👋

I'm Brenda.   
I'm a Data Scientist and Web Developer 🇨🇲🇪🇦 because it's fun to see many different perspectives..  
I'm interested in:
| **Topic** | **Tools** |
|---|---|
|Data Art and Visualization | ![Tableau](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tableau-blue) ![D3.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/D3.js-blue) ![Data Wrapper](https://img.shields.io/badge/DataWrapper-blue) ![Infogram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Infogram-blue) |  
|Data Analysis | ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-pink) ![Excel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Excel-pink) ![D3.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/D3.js-pink) |     

Outside of my Data Science and Developement projects, I enjoy:
  - Hikes and Heights 🥾 📸
  - Novels 📖 and Movies 🎞️
  - Art 🖋️🎊
  - Snorkeling and Surfing 🌊    
 
I have a BSc in Information Communication Technology from the ICT University.   
After my BSc, I did an internship in the Banking and Finance sector and got interested in Big Data thinking it would be a fine cross between _design_ and _tech_.   
So I went in for an MSc in Data Science. During the MSc, I got wind of Data Art and Data Visualization and _hurray_ 🎊    
Then, I went in for another MSc in FrontEnd Developement to get better at design and _Chef's kiss_ 🥳

While you are here, take a look at my [👩‍💻Data Projects](https://portfolio-qb.vercel.app/) or [🎨 FrontEnd Projects](https://qb-3d.netlify.app)  

I do 🌱:  
  * Data Analysis and Visualization
  * Data Engineering
  * UI and Front-End Developement
  * WebGl 🤔and 3D Modelling and Design
  
I sometimes prototype on sandboxes 💻 :  
  * [Intersection Observer](https://codesandbox.io/s/intersection-observer-framer-motion-gl42y2?file=/src/index.js) in ReactJS
  * I had fun working with [_ontology data_](https://lagom-qb.github.io/Fraud-Detection/intro.html) and was 🤯 
  * [3dScene Pokeball](https://lagom-qb.github.io/3dScene/) Thingie

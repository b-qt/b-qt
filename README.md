### Hello there 👋

I'm Brenda. I'm a Data Scientist and MSc student somewhere in Spain 🇪🇦.  
I'm interested in **Data Art** , **Visualization** and **Analysis** because everything therein depends on _perspective_ and it's fun to see how many different perspectives do exist.  

While you are here, take a look at my [📕_work_](https://portfolio-qb.vercel.app/)  

Outside of Data Science, I enjoy:
  - Walks 🥾 📸
  - Novels 📖 and Movies 🎞️
  - Drawing 🖋️
  - Novelties 🎊
 
I have a BSc in Information Communication Technology from the ICT University.   
After my BSc, I did a 3 months internship in the Banking and Finance sector and got interested in Big Data thinking it would be a fine cross between _design_ and _tech_.   
So I went in for an MSc in Data Science. During the MSc, I got wind of Data Art and Data Visualization and _hurray_ 🎊

I do 🌱:  
  * Data Analysis and Manipulation
  * Data Visualization
  * Data Modelling
  * Front-End Developement

I'm interested in 🤔:
  * Information Design and Data Journalism 🔭
  * Data Analysis
  
I also prototype on various sandboxes 💻 :   
  * [Intersection Observer](https://codesandbox.io/s/intersection-observer-framer-motion-gl42y2?file=/src/index.js) in ReactJS

  You can always 📫 [reach me](mailto:tebid.qb@gmail.com) or 📜[portfolio](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ek4xPBiWYX0lY--kaioftkw31bRd7zH3/view?usp=sharing) to work on a project or just for a lovely chat.

👯 BTW I’m also looking to collaborate on short-term social projects.

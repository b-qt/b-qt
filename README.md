### Hello there 👋

I'm Brenda. I'm a Data Scientist and Web Developer somewhere 🇨🇲🇪🇦.  
I'm interested in **Data Art** , **Visualization** and **Analysis** because everything therein depends on _perspective_ and it's fun to see how many different perspectives do exist.  

While you are here, take a look at my [👩‍💻Data Projects](https://portfolio-qb.vercel.app/) or [🎨 FrontEnd Projects](https://qb-3d.netlify.app)  

Outside of my Data Science and Developement projects, I enjoy:
  - Walks 🥾 📸
  - Novels 📖 and Movies 🎞️
  - Drawing 🖋️
  - Novelties 🎊
  - Diving and Surfing 🌊    
 
I have a BSc in Information Communication Technology from the ICT University.   
After my BSc, I did a 3 months internship in the Banking and Finance sector and got interested in Big Data thinking it would be a fine cross between _design_ and _tech_.   
So I went in for an MSc in Data Science. During the MSc, I got wind of Data Art and Data Visualization and _hurray_ 🎊    
Then, I went in for another MSc in FrontEnd Developement to get better at design and _Chef's kiss_ 🥳

I do 🌱:  
  * Data Analysis and Manipulation
  * Data Visualization
  * Data Modelling
  * UI Developement
  * Front-End Developement

I'm interested in 🤔:
  * Information Design and Data Journalism 🔭
  * Data Analysis
  * WebGl
  * 3D Modelling and Design
  * UI design
  
I also prototype on various sandboxes 💻 :   
  * [Intersection Observer](https://codesandbox.io/s/intersection-observer-framer-motion-gl42y2?file=/src/index.js) in ReactJS
  * [Custom Edges](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-flow-custom-nodes-3tejtp?file=/src/Components/Flow.jsx) in React Flow   

And ... I had fun working with _ontology data_ 🤯 check it out 👉 [here](https://lagom-qb.github.io/Fraud-Detection/intro.html)

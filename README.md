### Hello there 👋

I'm Brenda. I'm a Data Scientist and MSc student somewhere in Spain 🇪🇦.  
I'm interested in **Data Art** , **Visualization** and **Analysis** because everything therein depends on _perspective_ and it's fun to see how many different perspectives do exist.  

While you are here, take a look at my _work_👉 [📕](https://lagom-qb.github.io)   

Outside of Data Science, I enjoy:
  - Walks 🥾 📸
  - Novels 📖 and Movies 🎞️
  - Drawing 🖋️
  - Novelties 🎊
 
I have a BSc in Information Communication Technology from the ICT University.   
After my BSc, I did a 3 months internship in the Banking and Finance sector and got interested in Big Data thinking it would be a fine cross between _design_ and _tech_.   
So I went in for an MSc in Data Science. During the MSc, I got wind of Data Art and Data Visualization and _hurray_🎊

I do 🌱:  
  * Data Analysis and Manipulation
  * Data Visualization
  * Data Modelling
  * Front-End Developement

I'm interested in 🤔:
  * Information Design and Data Journalism 🔭
  * Data Analysis

You can always 📫 [reach me](mailto:tebid.quinsy@ictuniversity.org) to work on a project or just for a lovely chat.

👯 BTW I’m also looking to collaborate on short-term social projects.

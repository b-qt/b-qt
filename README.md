### Hello there 👋

I'm Brenda.   
I'm a Data Scientist and Web Developer 🇨🇲🇪🇦.  
I'm interested in:   
- **Data Art**
- **Visualization** ![Tableau](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tableau-blue) ![D3.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/D3.js-blue) ![Data Wrapper](https://img.shields.io/badge/DataWrapper-blue) ![Infogram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Infogram-blue)   
- **Analysis** ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-pink) ![Excel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Excel-pink) ![D3.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/D3.js-pink)   
... because it's fun to see many different perspectives.

Outside of my Data Science and Developement projects, I enjoy:
  - Hikes and Heights 🥾 📸
  - Novels 📖 and Movies 🎞️
  - Art 🖋️🎊
  - Snorkeling and Surfing 🌊    
 
I have a BSc in Information Communication Technology from the ICT University.   
After my BSc, I did a 3 months internship in the Banking and Finance sector and got interested in Big Data thinking it would be a fine cross between _design_ and _tech_.   
So I went in for an MSc in Data Science. During the MSc, I got wind of Data Art and Data Visualization and _hurray_ 🎊    
Then, I went in for another MSc in FrontEnd Developement to get better at design and _Chef's kiss_ 🥳

### Hello there 👋

I'm Brenda.   
I'm a Data Scientist and Web Developer 🇨🇲🇪🇦 because it's fun to see many different perspectives..  
I'm interested in:
| **Topic** | **Tools** |
|---|---|
|Data Art and Visualization | ![Tableau](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tableau-blue) ![D3.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/D3.js-blue) ![Data Wrapper](https://img.shields.io/badge/DataWrapper-blue) ![Infogram](https://img.shields.io/badge/Infogram-blue) |  
|Data Analysis | ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-pink) ![Excel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Excel-pink) ![D3.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/D3.js-pink) |     

Outside of my Data Science and Developement projects, I enjoy:
  - Hikes and Heights 🥾 📸
  - Novels 📖 and Movies 🎞️
  - Art 🖋️🎊
  - Snorkeling and Surfing 🌊    
 
I have a BSc in Information Communication Technology from the ICT University.   
After my BSc, I did an internship in the Banking and Finance sector and got interested in Big Data thinking it would be a fine cross between _design_ and _tech_.   
So I went in for an MSc in Data Science. During the MSc, I got wind of Data Art and Data Visualization and _hurray_ 🎊    
Then, I went in for another MSc in FrontEnd Developement to get better at design and _Chef's kiss_ 🥳

While you are here, take a look at my [👩‍💻Data Projects](https://portfolio-qb.vercel.app/)   
## Data Analysis
|Project| Project Description | Project Link|
|---|---|---|
|🥾🏖️ Hitch Hiker's travel guide| Data analysis to explore data taken from Numeo to better understand what travelers should consider when travelling in order to make better financial decisions | [![Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-green)](https://lagom-qb.github.io/Hitch-Hiker-s-Travel-Guide/)|
|📝 Gender Inequality in HIV infections in adolescents| Analysis of data taken from data.world to look at the trend of spread of HIV in adolescents as time goes by|[![Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-green)](https://lagom-qb.github.io/Gender-Inequality-in-HIV-Infections-in-Adolescents/)|
|Reddit r/technews| A javascript realtime word analysis of data pulled using the reddit api from the r/technews subreddit for the current month, Looking at how often posts are reposted and what the population is talking about currently | [![Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-green)](https://lagom-qb.github.io/technews/)|
|Depression Anxiety Stress Scale | I chose to look at these 3 mental illnesses which in my opinion are the silent killers some people seem to not take seriously enough: Anxiety, Depression, Stress. The data used was collected for a while up to and including 2018 and its demographics are explained in the “cookbook”. The goal here is to gain and provide more insights to silent killers like Depression, Anxiety and Stress and to represent this data in a way which is more engaging is important to those affected and those susceptible so they know how to identify, deal with their situations and when to throw in the towel to ask for help.|[![Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-green)](https://lagom-qb.github.io/dv_dass/progress)|
|Fraud Detection|The goal of the project was to build a knowledge system to classify a transaction as fraudulent or non-fraudulent and using specified rules, define what sort of fraud was carried out.The client provided us with a .owl file.|[![Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-green)](https://lagom-qb.github.io/Fraud-Detection/intro.html)|
|Dear Abby|The goal of this exercise is to analyze and visualize trends in data sent over the years to cable network "Dear Abby" and to view trends and changes in topics of conversation.|[![Project](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lagom-QB/Dear-Abby/HEAD)|


## Data Engineering
|Project| Project Description| Project Link|
|---|---|---|
|La Liga | The goal of this project is to develop skills in data integration, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and data transformation using a sports dataset. The project will focus on collecting, cleaning, transforming, and loading sports-related data into a target repository for analysis and reporting purposes.Because the dataset concerns data on the top 5 European leagues and this data seems to be alot at first glance, I'm going to narrow it down by working on data on the *Liga Feminina* for Spain. | [![GithubLink](https://img.shields.io/badge/ProjectPage-purple)](https://github.com/lagom-QB/Data-Engineering/tree/main)[![StreamLit](https://img.shields.io/badge/StreamLit-purple)](https://la-liga.streamlit.app/)
